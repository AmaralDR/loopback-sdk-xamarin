### What is this repository for? ###

Creation of Loopback SDK for Xamarin Studio or C# project.

* Quick summary: 
    The Repository contains 4 folders.
    "lb-xm" folder contains the SDK Generator: JS Code running a compiled c# code that creates the SDK. E.g. In shell "node lb-xm d:\someserver\server\server.js" will create CS code for the SDK, whereas "node lb-xm d:\someserver\server\server.js c sdk.dll" will compile an sdk DLL. 
    Second folder, "SDKGeneratorDLL", contains the open source of the c# part of the generator. This project's end result is 'LBXamarinSDKGenerator.dll' which should be placed inside 'lb-xm/bin'.
    Thirdly, "SDK Example" folder contains the example server and Xamarin solution of an App using a compiled SDK.
	Last folder is "UnitTests", containing Testers for the project: it should get an input of the CS code generated by lb-xm.

* Version 1.0

### How do I get set up? ###

* On Windows
	1. Go into lb-xm and run 'npm install' in shell.
* On MacOS
	1. Have Homebrew installed - 'ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"'.
	2. If you don't have Mono x64 installed, run 'brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tjanczuk/edge/master/tools/mono64.rb' in shell.
	3. run 'brew install pkg-config'.
	4. run 'npm install'.
	
* After Setup

    To compile an SDK, take the folder "lb-xm", make sure you have all the dependencies and run "node lb-xm d:\someserver\server\server.js c sdk.dll" in shell, where first parameter is the server.js file of the Loopback server, 'c' is a compilation flag and sdk.dll is the filename of the output compiled SDK.
    To review the C# part of the Generator (Source code of lb-xm/bin/LBXamarinSDKGenerator.dll), take a look at the folder "SDKGeneratorDLL".
    To review the example App using a compiled SDK, take the folder "SDK Example". This folder in turn contains a Loopback server and a Xamarin solution of an Android App using the SDK.
